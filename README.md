# MapUp Analytics Dashboard Assessment

This Angular-based dashboard is designed to visualize key insights from an Electric Vehicle (EV) dataset. The dashboard features multiple interactive widgets, including data visualizations like bar charts, pie charts, and scatter plots, built using Highcharts.

### Key Features:
- **EV Population by Year**: The total EV population per model year and EV type distribution is displayed.
- **EV Population by Region**: This visualization shows the total number of EVs in each region (County/State) and provides additional insights like electric range and CAFV eligibility.
- **EV Model Popularity**: Shows the distribution of EVs by make and model with average Base MSRP.
- **EV Range vs. MSRP**: Scatter plot showing the relationship between EV range and base MSRP, color-coded by vehicle type.

There was some issue during the deployment/hosting of the project, and I am currently looking into that issue.

### Technologies Used:
